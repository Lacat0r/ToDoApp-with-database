# ToDoApp-with-database

I created a ToDoApp using FastAPI and sqlite3 which will help to organize the daily tasks with a priority for each
 * Used HTTP Exceptions
 * Tested it by using Swagger UI
 * applied the CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete tasks
 * stored the values of each task in a database using sqlite3
